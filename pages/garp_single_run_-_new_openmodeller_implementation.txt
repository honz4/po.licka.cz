GARP is a genetic algorithm that creates ecological niche models for species. The models describe environmental conditions under which the species should be able to maintain populations. For input, GARP uses a set of point localities where the species is known to occur and a set of geographic layers representing the environmental parameters that might limit the species' capabilities to survive. Please refer to algorithm description for more information about the differences between this new GARP implementation and the Desktop GARP implementation.

GARP is a genetic algorithm that creates ecological niche models for species. The models describe environmental conditions under which the species should be able to maintain populations. For input, GARP uses a set of point localities where the species is known to occur and a set of geographic layers representing the environmental parameters that might limit the species' capabilities to survive. This implementation is a complete rewrite of the DesktopGarp code, and it also contains the following changes/improvements: (1) Gene values changed from integers (between 1 and 253) to floating point numbers (between -1.0 and 1.0). This avoids precision problems in environment values during projection (for example, if an environment variable has the value 2.56 in some raster cell and 2.76 in another one, DesktopGarp rounds them off to 3). (2) Atomic rules were removed since they seem to have little significance compared to the other rules. (3) Heuristic operator parameters (percentage of mutation and crossover per iteration) are now static since they used to converge to fixed values during the very first iterations. This implementation simply keeps the converged values. (4) A bug was fixed in the procedure responsible for ordering the rules. When a rule was only replacing another, it was being included in the wrong position.
