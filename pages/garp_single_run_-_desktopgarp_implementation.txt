This is the 2nd implementation of GARP algorithm, based on the original C code by David Stockwell. This version correspondss to the version in use by the DesktopGarp modeling package, with modifications to use OpenModeller base data access objects.

GARP is a genetic algorithm that creates ecological niche models for species. The models describe environmental conditions under which the species should be able to maintain populations. For input, GARP uses a set of point localities where the species is known to occur and a set of geographic layers representing the environmental parameters that might limit the species' capabilities to survive.
