Climate Space Model [CSM] is a principle components based algorithm developed by Dr. Neil Caithness. The component selection process int this algorithm implementation is based on the Broken-Stick cutoff where any component with an eigenvalue less than (n stddevs above a randomised sample) is discarded. \\
The original CSM was written as series of Matlab functions. \\
