  * co je master database?
  * __hiearchical classification__
    * **special interest points**
      * defined by data producer
      * related with map names (vyhledává do v databázi)
    * **geomorphologic interesting points**
      * terrain points -  peaks, mountain passes, depressions
      * kategorizace: conic, assymetrical, open, closed
      * they didnt use DEM but TIN, because of some difficulties to this methodology
        * One is that the centre of a pixel in raster data can not be coincident with the exact position of the spot height and the location of the pixel containing the spot height is unclear
        *  in raster format, each pixel of the DEM must be analyzed, while when using a DEM in TIN format, the analysis can be specifically restricted to the spot heights. Therefore, the use of a DEM in TIN format reduces substantially the computation time
      * peaks:
        * bud podle vyhledávací oblasti, hledám nejvyšší bod
        * nebo podle  tvaru Base Contour Line (je nemenší vrstevnice, obsahující jeden vrchol)
      * deprese:
        * podle minimálního souseda
    * **remainder points**


  * There must be a spot height approximately every 1200 meters on the roads
  * The input spot heights placed on the intersection of roads are considered as preferred spot heights

  * simplification,amalgamation, exaggeration, collapse, displacement
  * geodetic points,
  * points located in crossroads,
  * points in urban areas, and
  * points near roads, near generic toponyms and near places of touristic interest (like monuments, ruins, viewpoints, springs, etc.).
