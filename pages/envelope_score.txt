Uses the minimum and maximum observed value for each environmental variable to define bioclimatic envelopes. Probability of occurrence for a point is determined by the number of environmental variables within which the environmental values at the point fall into the min/max criteria.

Implements a lax Bioclimatic Envelope Algorithm. For each given environmental variable the algorithm finds the minimum and maximum at all occurrence sites. During model projection, the probability of occurrences is determined as: \\
  * p = layers within min-max threshold / number of layers

 Thus choosing a threshold of p=1 gives you the same model output as the original Bioclim model taking both the Suitable & Marginal classes as predicted presences. The Envelope Score algorithm is equivalent to the inclusive 'OR' implementation of Bioclim described in Pineiro et al (2007).
