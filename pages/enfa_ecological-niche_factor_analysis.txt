Algorithm based on presence only data using a modified principal components analysis.

Environmental Niche Factor Analysis (Hirzel et al, 2002) uses a modified principal components analysis to develop a model based on presence only data.  The observed environment is compared to the background data of the study area.  The analysis produces factors similar to a PCA.  The first factor is termed the 'marginality' of the species,** marginality is defined as the ecological distance between the species optimum and the mean habitat within the background data**. Other factors are termed the **'specialization', and are defined as the ratio of the ecological variance in mean habitat to that observed for the target species**.  Model projection uses the geomeans method of Hirzel & Arlettaz (2003)
