GARP is a genetic algorithm that creates ecological niche models for species. The models describe environmental conditions under which the species should be able to maintain populations. For input, GARP uses a set of point localities where the species is known to occur and a set of geographic layers representing the environmental parameters that might limit the species' capabilities to survive. This algorithm applies the Best Subsets procedure using the new openModeller implementation in each GARP run. Please refer to GARP single run algorithm description for more information about the differences between DesktopGarp and the new GARP implementation.
